# 🚁 eVTOL Flight Simulation

Welcome to the eVTOL Flight Simulation repository! This project provides a basic Python simulation of an Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, modeling vertical take-off, cruising, and landing phases. The simulation includes visualizations of altitude and velocity over time.

## 🌟 Features

- Simulates vertical take-off, cruising, and landing phases
- Visualizes altitude and velocity profiles using Matplotlib
- Simple and easy-to-understand Python code
- Customizable parameters for different flight scenarios

## 🛠 Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/eVTOL-Flight-Simulation.git
cd eVTOL-Flight-Simulation
```

### Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` does not exist, create it with the following content:

```plaintext
numpy
matplotlib
```

### Run the Simulation

Run the provided Python script to start the simulation:

```bash
python eVTOL_simulation.py
```

## 🚀 Usage

To run the simulation, execute the `eVTOL_simulation.py` script. The script will generate plots showing the altitude and velocity profiles over time.

```bash
python eVTOL_simulation.py
```

### Customize the Simulation

You can customize the simulation parameters such as mass, thrust, cruise altitude, and more by modifying the relevant variables in the `eVTOL_simulation.py` file.

```python
# Simulation parameters
g = 9.81  # Gravity (m/s^2)
mass = 1500  # eVTOL mass (kg)
max_thrust = 20000  # Maximum thrust (N)
cruise_altitude = 1000  # Cruise altitude (m)
cruise_velocity = 50  # Cruise horizontal velocity (m/s)
time_step = 0.1  # Time step for simulation (s)
total_time = 300  # Total simulation time (s)
```
