# Explanation of the Workings and Concept

The eVTOL (Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing) flight simulation project is designed to model the behavior of an eVTOL aircraft during different phases of flight: take-off, cruising, and landing. This simulation includes a detailed representation of the aircraft's physics, including thrust, drag, and gravitational forces, to provide an accurate depiction of its flight characteristics. The primary objective is to visualize altitude and velocity profiles over time, helping to understand the dynamics involved in eVTOL operations.

#### Working Concept

1. **Simulation Parameters**: The simulation starts by defining various parameters such as gravitational acceleration, the mass of the eVTOL, maximum thrust, drag coefficient, air density, frontal area, cruise altitude, and cruise velocity. These parameters are crucial for accurately modeling the aircraft's behavior.

2. **Flight Phases**:
   - **Take-Off Phase**: During this phase, the eVTOL generates maximum thrust to overcome gravitational forces and achieve vertical lift. The simulation calculates the vertical acceleration, velocity, altitude, and drag acting on the aircraft.
   - **Cruise Phase**: Once the eVTOL reaches the desired cruise altitude, it transitions to horizontal flight. In this phase, the vertical velocity is zero, and the aircraft maintains a constant horizontal velocity. The thrust is adjusted to balance the drag force.
   - **Landing Phase**: The final phase involves reducing thrust gradually to allow for a controlled descent. The simulation calculates the changing thrust, vertical acceleration, velocity, and altitude to ensure a smooth landing.

3. **Numerical Integration**: The simulation employs numerical integration techniques to solve the equations of motion over discrete time steps. This approach allows for the accurate computation of position, velocity, and acceleration at each time step, based on the forces acting on the eVTOL.

4. **Visualization**: The results of the simulation are visualized using Matplotlib, a popular Python library for plotting. The simulation generates plots for altitude and velocity profiles over time, providing a clear graphical representation of the eVTOL's flight dynamics.

5. **Customization**: Users can customize various parameters such as mass, thrust, drag coefficient, and flight durations to simulate different flight scenarios. This flexibility allows for exploring the impact of different design choices and operational conditions on the eVTOL's performance.

The code is organized in a Python script named `eVTOL_simulation.py`, which contains the core logic for the simulation. Additionally, a `requirements.txt` file is provided to ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed.

### File Names and Extensions

1. **Python Script**: 
   - **File Name**: `eVTOL_simulation.py`
   - **Description**: This file contains the complete code for the eVTOL flight simulation, including parameter definitions, numerical integration logic, and plotting functions.

2. **Requirements File**: 
   - **File Name**: `requirements.txt`
   - **Description**: This file lists all the Python packages required to run the simulation. It ensures that users can easily install the necessary dependencies using `pip`.

### Usage

To run the eVTOL flight simulation, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ and `pip` installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository containing the simulation code.
3. Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the simulation script:
   ```bash
   python eVTOL_simulation.py
   ```

This will execute the simulation and generate the plots for altitude and velocity profiles, providing insights into the eVTOL's flight dynamics.
